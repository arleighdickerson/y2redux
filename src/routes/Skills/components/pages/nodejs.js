    <h3>Skillset</h3>
    <p>
      I am by no means an expert at node, but if you were to browse my github,
      you would see that I definitely know my way around.
      Most of my node experience comes from wiring up react/webpack development servers,
      but I am also a fan of using express and mongodb together on the backend.

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Backend: <a href="https://github.com/arleighdickerson/react-redux-express/tree/master/server">React Redux Express</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Webpack/React Development Server: <a href="https://github.com/arleighdickerson/y2redux/blob/master/build/webpack.config.js">Y2Redux</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

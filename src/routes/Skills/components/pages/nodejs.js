    <h3>Skillset</h3>
    <p>
      I have a solid node skillset. These skills include server-side knowledge
      (<a href="https://expressjs.com">express</a>), <a href="https://webpack.github.io">webpack</a> work<em>flow</em>s,
      and <a
      href="http://es6-features.org">ES6</a>.
      If you were to browse my <a href="https://github.com/arleighdickerson">github</a>,
      you would see that I definitely know my way around.
      Most of my node experience comes from wiring up react/webpack development servers,
      but I am also a fan of using express and mongodb together on the backend.

    <h2>PHP</h2>
    <p>
      PHP gets a bad rap, perhaps deservedly. As somebody who uses it five days a week to pay bills,
      I see the good parts, the bad parts, and the downright janky parts.

    <p>
      It is also worth noting:

    <h2>Yii2</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com">Yii</a> is a <em>lightweight</em> PHP framework that does what you need it to and not a whole lot else.
      I acquired my first full-time industry job at the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org">American Economic
      Association</a> because
      I was a seasoned Yii developer. I also authored a trail of failed startup concepts using Yii.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a big fan of this framework because of its simplicity.
      If you understand the basic Object/Component/Model/Controller class hierarchy,
      then you can find your way around the rest of the framework fairly easily.
      After being hired at the AEA, I realized that this simplicity serves another purpose:
      bringing your colleagues (and managers) up to speed on the framework is a cake walk.
